Data analysis of weather dataset using Python and Pandas
# Weather Data Analysis Project üå¶Ô∏è

This project is an in-depth analysis of weather data, where I explored various weather patterns and statistics using Python and the Pandas library. This analysis was conducted as part of my commitment to apply what I learned from my recent Python certification course. 

## Project Overview
The goal of this project is to analyze a real-world weather dataset to gain insights into weather patterns and conditions. This includes analyzing temperature, visibility, humidity, wind speed, and other weather-related variables to answer specific questions.

## Key Questions Answered
Here are some of the key questions I addressed in this project:

1. **What are the unique wind speeds recorded in the data?**
2. **How many times was the weather exactly "Clear"?**
3. **What‚Äôs the mean visibility across the dataset?**
4. **What is the variance of relative humidity?**
5. **How many instances of "Snow" were recorded in the dataset?**
6. **Instances when the wind speed was above 24 km/h and visibility was 25 km**.

## Skills and Techniques Demonstrated
In this project, I applied various data analysis techniques, including:

- **Data Filtering and Cleaning**: Managed missing values, and selected specific conditions.
- **Aggregation and Grouping**: Used `groupby()`, `mean()`, `min()`, and `max()` functions to analyze data by different weather conditions.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Calculated mean, standard deviation, and variance to understand data distribution.
- **Conditional Filtering**: Extracted specific instances based on multiple conditions (e.g., wind speed above a certain threshold).

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For programming and data manipulation.
- **Pandas**: For data analysis, grouping, and filtering.

## Key Findings
Here are some of the insights I discovered:

- The **average visibility** is approximately **27.66 km**.
- There were **1326 occurrences** where the weather was "Clear".
- The **variance in relative humidity** is **286.17**, indicating varying humidity levels.
- There were several instances where "Snow" was recorded, showing seasonal weather patterns.
